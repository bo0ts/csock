It would be nice to be sure of anything the way some people are of everything.
Success is relative: It is what we can make of the mess we have made of things.
		-- T.S. Eliot, "The Family Reunion"
Writing is turning one's worst moments into money.
		-- J.P. Donleavy
If one tells the truth, one is sure, sooner or later, to be found out.
		-- Oscar Wilde, "Phrases and Philosophies for the Use
		of the Young"
A distraught patient phoned her doctor's office.  "Was it true," the woman
inquired, "that the medication the doctor had prescribed was for the rest
of her life?"
	She was told that it was.  There was just a moment of silence before
the woman proceeded bravely on.  "Well, I'm wondering, then, how serious my
condition is.  This prescription is marked `NO REFILLS'".
Too much of a good thing is WONDERFUL.
		-- Mae West
