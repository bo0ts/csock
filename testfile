Let sleeping dogs lie.
		-- Charles Dickens
The mirror sees the man as beautiful, the mirror loves the man; another
mirror sees the man as frightful and hates him; and it is always the same
being who produces the impressions.
		-- Marquis D.A.F. de Sade
I don't wanna argue, and I don't wanna fight,
But there will definitely be a party tonight...
